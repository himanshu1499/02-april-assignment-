    "Class imbalance: If the data used to train the model has class imbalance (i.e., one class has significantly more samples than the others), the model may become biased towards the majority class. This can be identified from the confusion matrix by observing a large number of true positives and false negatives for the majority class, while the opposite may be true for the minority classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Misclassification patterns: The confusion matrix can help identify patterns in the model's misclassifications. For example, if the model consistently misclassifies one class as another, this may indicate that the two classes are too similar and the model needs more features or data to distinguish between them.\n",
